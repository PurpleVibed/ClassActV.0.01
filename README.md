**This is a prototype**
This is a submission to the Congressional App Challenge.
I used visual studio, .net maui, c#, and xaml
I know the code is iffy and only works with android to my knowledge. 

Inspired by our own struggles, our group decided to create an app to simplify navigating school activities.
We realized that we didn't have a school app which delved into what we needed to do for school so we looked at what we thought about what would be 
conveinent to have in a easily navigatable app, which included class work, club information, due dates, and events. If we were to make a 2.0 version
of this app we would have these ideas be fully functional and to have more features. To have this app be fully functional we believe that it would
be installed millions of times from students attending high schools, collages, and universities. It would be such a helpfull tool that I believe 
that it could even raise some grades. To have a, "all in one" app for education would be something that I consider an absolute goal. Creating this
app has been an absolute joy for me and my peirs, and if we win I think having won a Congressional App Challenge wouldn't escape our portfolios.
